// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

READ x
	IF x % 2 == 0
		print "even"
	ELSE
		print "odd"
	ENDIF

ask for value (a number)
modulo number by 2
if value is even print even
if value is odd print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.   

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

//a

numbers == num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

ask for 5 numbers

//b

num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum
sum / 5 = average
print "this is the average"

ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers
divide sum of 5 numbers by 5
print the average

//c

count = 5
// ask for 5 numbers
max = -999
min = 999
total = 0

for each value in count
	total = total + value
	if value > max
	max = value
	else if value < min
	min = value

print "minimum" min
print "maximum" max
